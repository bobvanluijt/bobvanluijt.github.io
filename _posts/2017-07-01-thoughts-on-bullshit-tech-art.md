During my morning coffee, I’m reading the following tweet and accompanying article:


> [](https://twitter.com/quasimondo/status/881064561310400512)


Unfortunately for me, the tweet is written a week after my [talk at Festival Mundial](https://twitter.com/bobvanluijt/status/878603726239531008) on the topic of art and digital technology. This, because the point [Mario Klingemann](http://mario-klingemann.tumblr.com) is making with this single tweet could have served as a great way to explain what the merging of AI and art is _not_ about.

Let me explain why.

From the article [_Artificial Intelligence: THE END OF ART AS WE KNOW IT._](https://medium.com/@gomattymo/artificial-intelligence-the-end-of-art-as-we-know-it-bc6655fb18b6)

> “TMFA [The Most Famous Artist] has partnered with a group of anonymous hackers to build a proprietary artificial intelligence powered by big data capable of emulating and breeding art styles to produce high-quality original artworks.”

The above text means absolutely nothing. It is empty rhetoric used to draw people to an art gallery.

Same example, different content:

> “Justin Bieber has partnered with a group of anonymous composers to build a proprietary composition powered by musical instruments capable of emulating and breeding art styles to produce high-quality original artworks.”

You see? Empty rhetorics.

You might wonder why this is an issue at all. Who cares? Well, I do. Because this proves that artists can be just as guilty of using terminologies like artificial intelligence, big data, and the likes in a holistic way for the sole purpose of drawing attention to a product, service or -in this case- an art gallery.

A bad thing, because I am a firm believer that the digital technology available to us will help us to create new ways of [seeing the world in the form of new art disciplines](https://bob.wtf/technology-as-an-aesthetic-discipline-300eba3179f0).

Luckily, there are also artists doing the exact opposite, like [Klingemann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_cNRzlClnk).
