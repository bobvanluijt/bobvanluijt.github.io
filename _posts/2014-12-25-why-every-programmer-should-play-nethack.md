<h4>A story about how I created music out of data</h4>

I have created a music composition based completely on variables. To be more precise: variables that I get from a <a href="http://eepurl.com/bS52SL" target="_blank"> Brain Sensing headband</a>.

The composition itself has form and instrumentation. But all variables- keys, tempo, duration, note length, panning etcetera- are determined by the variables that I get delivered through the headband.

I asked a dancer to react, in an improvisation, to the music and ‘choices’ that come from his own brain.
